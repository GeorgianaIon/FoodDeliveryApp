# FoodDeliveryApp
 
This project is supposed to allow customers to order food from different restaurants. It helps people to get the food delivered when they don't want or cannot go to pick it up. It should allow people to order but also the restaurant to publish their offers. Thus, two users will use the app: Restraunt Owner and Customer.
